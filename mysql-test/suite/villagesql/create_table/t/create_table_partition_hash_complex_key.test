# Test CREATE TABLE with HASH partitioning using COMPLEX as partition key
# Tests that COMPLEX custom type gives proper error when used as HASH partition key
# NOTE: Currently gives generic ERROR 1659 "Field 'value' is of a not allowed type for this type of partitioning"
# Should give more specific error about COMPLEX type not being supported as partition key
