# This test verifies that villint.sh preserves include blocks separated by blank lines.
# The my_rapidjson_size_t.h header is in its own block before the rapidjson/* headers.
# With IncludeBlocks: Preserve, clang-format should not reorder across blocks.
# The file should remain unchanged after villint runs.
